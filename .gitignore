# Ignore everything initially
*

# Un-ignore files with an extension (anything with a '.' in the name)
!*.*

# Un-ignore directories (so Git can traverse into them)
!*/

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# You might need to explicitly un-ignore specific files without extensions
# that you DO want to track (like configuration files, scripts, etc.)
# Example:
# !your_script_without_extension
# !Makefile
# !.env
# !.bashrc
